* blast2bed
** Description
This script can be used to convert a tabular blast output
to a bed file.
** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./blast2bed <input-file>
#+END_SRC

*** Notes
- The input file should be generated with the outfmt 6 or 7 
  flag.
- If the input file name has an any file extension, it 
  will be replaced by '.bed' for the output file.
  Otherwise, the output file will be <inputfile>.bed
- The score is always set to 0

The resulting bed file has the format:

<subjectID> <start> <end> <QueryID> <score> <strand>
